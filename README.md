# Portfolio - Leo Giesen


This project is deployed at [leogiesen.de](https://leogiesen.de/#/).
The original version of my portfolio can be inspected [here](https://github.com/lgiesen/portfolio-v1), which I created with HTMl5 CSS3 and JavaScript when I was 18.

## Project Setup

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com "VS Code") is the recommended code editor
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node")
3. [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cli): `npm install -g @vue/cli #Install Command Line Interface`

Check your versions:

```
   node --version              # v16.14.2
   npm --version               # 8.5.0
   vue --version               # @vue/cli 5.0.8
```

### Serve/Start Front-end - Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
#or start via User Interface with: vue ui
```

### Build for Production

```
npm run build #Compiles and minifies for production
```

To publish the changes, the "dist" directory contents are to be copied and pushed to the [portfolio-v2-dist](https://github.com/lgiesen/portfolio-v2-dist) repository because the hosting is based on it. This must be performed because the hosting plan is unable to build from production by itself.
